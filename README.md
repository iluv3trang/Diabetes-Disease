### Impact of Smoking on Diabetes Prediction 

Diabetes is a global epidemic affecting millions of people worldwide. It is a chronic disease when glucose accumulates in the bloodstream due to the pancreas not producing enough insulin or the body's inability to utilize it effectively. The frequent episodes of hyperglycemia are a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes [1]. Over time, they can lead to serious health problems like kidney disease, heart disease, and vision loss.
The primary objective of this study is to investigate the impact of smoking on the prediction of diabetes, as well as other factors that may contribute to the prediction of diabetes. This investigation will involve the use of logistic regression and propensity score analysis. To what extent does smoking behavior impact the prediction of diabetes incidence, and are there other factors that contribute to the prediction of diabetes? How do logistic regression and propensity score analysis help to understand the relationship between predictors and the incidence of diabetes? By analyzing these relationships, we aim to develop a predictive model to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and intervention.
